# name-puzzle

[openSCAD](https://www.openscad.org/) script to generate 3D printable name puzzles.

Best if used with a symmetrical font whose bold characters are the same shape as its normal characters (looking at you, comic sans).

You'll need to download Instruction to use that font (see below).
